# Dataset Research

> **AI-assisted desktop application for dataset analysis and academic research intelligence.**

![Dataset Research](screenshots/1.png)

Dataset Research is a desktop application designed to help **Data Science students and researchers** transform datasets into meaningful research insights.

For Windows installer prerequisites and build steps, see [Windows Installer](docs/WINDOWS_INSTALLER.md).
The v3.0.0 GitHub release title, description, and publishing checklist are in [GITHUB_RELEASE_v3.md](docs/GITHUB_RELEASE_v3.md).
For central usage tracking setup, see [Usage Telemetry Setup](docs/USAGE_TELEMETRY.md).
Untuk protokol benchmark dan evaluasi kualitas/ML/research, lihat [Protokol Evaluasi](docs/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md).

The application combines **dataset analysis, Machine Learning intelligence, NLP, academic literature search, and research analysis** into a single desktop workspace.

Instead of only analyzing a dataset, Dataset Research helps users understand:

- What is inside the dataset?
- What problems exist in the data?
- What Machine Learning methods may be suitable?
- What previous research has been conducted?
- How relevant are existing academic papers?
- What research opportunities may be explored further?

# Evaluasi dan Benchmark

Proyek menyediakan runner evaluasi terpisah untuk mengukur deteksi target/task/domain, ranking paper, kandidat research gap, kualitas data, robustness input, dan performa. Evaluasi tidak mengubah alur aplikasi.

Quick DEV (offline, tanpa data eksternal):

```powershell
python -m evaluation.run --only all --offline --dev --quick
```

Benchmark dataset publik memerlukan manifest minimal 40 dataset dengan label yang diverifikasi dari sumber resmi. Label paper dan research gap harus diisi oleh penilai manusia; project tidak mengarang angka atau label ground truth. Dataset, snapshot, label, mapping blind, dan hasil lokal tersimpan di `data/evaluation/` dan tidak diunggah ke Git.

TEST adalah evaluasi final satu kali setelah hasil DEV dan label ditinjau. Panduan penyiapan lengkap ada di [Protokol Evaluasi](docs/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md).

# About The Project

Finding a suitable research topic from a dataset can be challenging.

Researchers often need to perform several different tasks manually, including:

1. Understanding the dataset
2. Cleaning and profiling the data
3. Determining suitable Machine Learning approaches
4. Searching academic literature
5. Comparing previous studies
6. Identifying potential research opportunities

Dataset Research was created to bring these processes into one structured workflow.

The application follows this general pipeline:

```text
UPLOAD DATASET
       ↓
DATASET ANALYSIS
       ↓
DATASET FINGERPRINT
       ↓
KEYWORD EXTRACTION
       ↓
RESEARCH DOMAIN DETECTION
       ↓
ML TASK DETECTION
       ↓
ML METHOD ANALYSIS
       ↓
ACADEMIC PAPER SEARCH
       ↓
PAPER ANALYSIS
       ↓
DATASET / TOPIC / METHOD MATCHING
       ↓
RELEVANCE RANKING
       ↓
RESEARCH LANDSCAPE
       ↓
RESEARCH TREND
       ↓
POTENTIAL RESEARCH GAP
       ↓
RESEARCH REPORT
```

The goal is not to automatically generate research.

Dataset Research acts as a **research intelligence assistant** that provides analytical information to support human decision-making.

# Installation

## Run From Source

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/dataset-research.git
cd dataset-research
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment on Windows:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:

```powershell
python run.py
```

---

# Windows Executable

Dataset Research can be packaged as a Windows application using **PyInstaller**.

For the project build, the repository includes:

```text
build_windows_installer.bat
```

The build configuration also includes the application logo resource:

```text
app/ui/assets/logo.jpg
```

The build creates the Windows installer in `hasil_compile/` and the standalone application files in `hasil_compile/payload/`.

---

# Usage Telemetry

Dataset Research can send limited usage events to a central MySQL database through the FastAPI backend. This is separate from the local SQLite database used for projects and datasets.

The desktop app can send these events:

- `app_open`
- `analysis_started`
- `analysis_completed`
- `analysis_failed`

Each event contains an installation ID, event name, feature name, status, duration, app version, and timestamp. Dataset contents, file paths, analysis results, user input, and API keys are not included. Telemetry is optional; it is disabled when `TELEMETRY_API_URL` is empty. Events are sent in the background and may be missed when the API is unavailable.

## Local Development

1. Create the MySQL database and event table by running `mysql_setup.sql` in MySQL Workbench. Follow the comments in that file to create separate API and admin accounts with strong passwords.
2. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and configure the MySQL connection using the API account. Keep this file private; it is ignored by Git.
3. Install the project dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Start the API from the project root:

   ```powershell
   python -m uvicorn backend.api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
   ```

5. Set `TELEMETRY_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000` in the desktop `.env` file and run `python run.py`.
6. View daily usage in MySQL Workbench with `SELECT * FROM vw_daily_usage ORDER BY report_date DESC;`.

The local URL only works while the API and MySQL are running on the same computer. For production, deploy the API and MySQL on an always-on server, use HTTPS for the API, and set the desktop app's API URL to that server. Never put MySQL credentials in the desktop app. The API account should only have `INSERT` permission, while the separate admin account should only have read access. See [Usage Telemetry Setup](docs/USAGE_TELEMETRY.md) for more detail.

# Example Use Case

Suppose a researcher has a dataset containing information about passenger survival.

Dataset Research may identify:

```text
Research Domain
Transportation / Social Research

Possible ML Task
Classification

Possible Target
Survival

Possible Methods
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM
- KNN
```

The system can then generate academic search queries such as:

```text
Passenger Survival Prediction
Passenger Survival Machine Learning
Passenger Survival Classification
Random Forest Passenger Survival
```

The resulting academic papers can then be analyzed and ranked according to their relevance.

---

# Important Notes

Dataset Research is an **assistive research tool**, not an automatic research generator.

The results should be interpreted as analytical recommendations.

In particular:

- ML recommendations are not guaranteed to be optimal.
- Semantic similarity does not prove research equivalence.
- Potential research gaps must be verified against the original literature.
- Academic papers should be read and evaluated by the researcher.
- Outliers should not automatically be removed.
- The original dataset should remain unchanged.
- Internet access is required for academic literature searches.
- Local dataset analysis can operate independently from academic search services.
